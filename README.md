## Description
Rusty Chat is  a chat server that allows various users to communicate via a chat server.

## Instructions
- To see the options for the server, do:
  ```
  cd server
  cargo build
  ./target/debug/chat-server --help
  ```
  Mainly, running the executable with `-r` runs the server through the host IP, so that different machines can connect to   it. The default ip is `localhost`
- To see the options for the client, do:
  ```
  cd client
  cargo build
  ./target/debug/chat-client --help
  ```
  Running the executable alone connects to the client to `localhost`, otherwise an IP address can be specified as an argument

## Code Architecture
* Server
   * Take advantage of Rustâ€™s concurrency
   * Receive/relay messages to the channel
   * Keep track of connected users
* Client
   * Terminal chat window (GUI)
   * Let user send messages and change nickname
